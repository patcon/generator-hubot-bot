# generator-hubot-bot [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/patcon/generator-hubot-bot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/patcon/generator-hubot-bot)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for your new Hubot.


## Installation
- `npm install -g generator-hubot-bot`

## Usage
- `yo hubot-bot`

## Getting Started

See [Hubot's Getting Started
guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md) for
details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.
`generator-hubot-script` is a replacement for `hubot --create`,
so you skip that step if you've done `yo hubot` already.
